It was a miracle season for Lando, and his path to the World Drivers' Championship (WDC) title was nothing short of spectacular. As the chequered flag waved at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the final race of the season, Lando stood atop the podium, the newly crowned WDC champion, with an astonishing comeback that left the F1 world in awe.

Going into the Brazilian Grand Prix, the penultimate leg before the final four rounds, Lando's chances of claiming the WDC title were as low as 0.02%, trailing Max by 47 points in the standings. However, he wasn't ready to give up just yet. The fate of his season was hanging by a thread, but Lando chose to focus on what he could control.

Lando scored a hard-fought 5th place in Brazil, fighting a gritty battle with several cars in front. Meanwhile, Max struggled with an eventful weekend, particularly in the final stint, pushing him down to 9th place. This swing in points didn't ignite much hope for Lando's title aim yet, but every little bit helped.

The very next week saw F1 debut its first ever Las Vegas Grand Prix, a new sprint layout to charm drivers and teams alike. Lando grabbed another set of points in third position, overcoming the dangers and spectacular passes over the unforgiving tarmac. Max, although well at ease in terms of position in the championship, secured 4th position and seemed for all intents and purposes closer to formally clinching the WDC crown.

Las Vegas spelled excitement, but what awaited the F1 drivers at the infamous Qatar GP left them completely on their guard. Lando reinvigorated his slim WDC hopes with an inspired run that earned him a valiant 2nd place. As Max fumbled to only 6th, Lando narrowed the gap between the two.

With Max now just 11 points clear, Lando and his team strategized frantically on a plan that might just overthrow the reigning champion. A first-place victory and a non-score for Max would automatically earn him the title. At this point, it seemed implausible, yet in the unpredictable world of Formula 1, miracles do happen.

Then came the final lap at the gruelling Abu Dhabi GP, where championship dreams would be realized and shattered. A thrilling conclusion awaited, and to everyone's surprise, it panned out in the most unexpected manner. As the field approached the chequered flag, Max struggled to edge forward from 10th place, caught behind the same cars as in Brazil. The wheels seemingly coming loose for Max, he was thwarted by a myriad of lapped and unwilling cars.

But it was Lando who exuded a calm sense of confidence, fighting an audacious duel over his well-placed top rivals and grabbing victory at the final circuit. When the season-defining final results became clear, everyone in attendance held their breaths as the screen revealed Max's point tally to be marginally short of Lando's - despite leading the championship table for an unprecedented period. Amid a season not deemed entirely perfect for Lando due to its challenging odds at one stage, fate provided the needed twist in the storybook ending, leaving millions awestruck in reverent silence.

Max indeed earned the 390 points - just one point shy of the winner - not an unprecedented situation in F1 - a chilling reminder that no matter how seemingly unsurmountable your championship is, even when riding high, you stand an arm's length from losing the same world championship due to an excruciating narrow margin of probability, timing, race incident or untimely mechanical gremlins.
