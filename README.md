# WDC Simulation: Can Lando Chase Down Max?

The World Drivers‚Äô Championship (WDC) seemed like it was securely in Max Verstappen‚Äôs hands this season‚Äîafter all, he‚Äôs had the fastest car on the grid by a country mile. But while Max has been untouchable, it's safe to say Red Bull‚Äôs ‚Äúteam‚Äù approach doesn‚Äôt exactly ring true; let‚Äôs be honest, they have _one_ driver seriously vying for the title!

As the season progresses, however, other teams have been gaining ground. Enter McLaren, with Lando Norris now eyeing that championship. With every race, he's inching closer to the Dutchman, setting up an intense showdown in the last few races of the season.

## About This Simulation

This simulation is built to explore the different paths that could lead to Lando‚Äôs crowning moment. With four races remaining in the season, we simulate every possible outcome to calculate the probability of Lando winning the WDC. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it works:

### 1. **Simulating Race Outcomes**

For each race, we simulate various scenarios based on possible finishing positions for both Max and Lando. Points are awarded according to F1 standards, giving us a tree of possible outcomes across the final four races.

### 2. **Visualising the Decision Tree**

Each possible outcome is displayed in a graph, where each branch represents a potential race result. At every node, the points for both Max and Lando are tracked, making it easy to see how the WDC points evolve with each scenario.

### 3. **Pruning the Tree**

Since we‚Äôre only interested in outcomes where Lando wins, we prune away any branches where Max retains his lead over Lando. This leaves a streamlined tree showing only the paths where Lando could realistically end up champion.

## The Probability of Lando‚Äôs Victory

By analysing the pruned tree, we calculate the probability of Lando clinching the title. If there‚Äôs any driver capable of knocking Max‚Äôs crown off, it‚Äôs McLaren‚Äôs rising star.

## Story Generation: Lando‚Äôs Path to Victory

As an extra ‚Äúnice-to-have,‚Äù our system also takes one of the paths where Lando wins and crafts an enthralling story around it. This gives a glimpse into what a fairy-tale ending for the McLaren driver might look like, race by race, as he closes the points gap and ultimately takes the championship title.

Whether or not it plays out in reality, this simulation provides a fun and strategic look into what it would take for Lando to dethrone the Dutchman. Keep an eye on these final races‚Äîwho knows, we might just see a McLaren miracle! üèÜ
